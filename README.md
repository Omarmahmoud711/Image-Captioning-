# Image Captioning with Deep Learning and Attention

This project involves building a deep learning model to generate captions for images. It utilizes advanced neural network concepts, including Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for feature extraction and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) with Attention mechanisms for sequence modeling.

## Project Overview
- **Objective**: Develop an image captioning system that generates textual descriptions for a given image.
- **Dataset**: The [Flickr8k Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dataset-name), containing 8,000 images with 5 captions each, is used for training and evaluation.
- **Deep Learning Framework**: TensorFlow and Keras.
- **Model Architecture**: The model consists of two main components:
  - **Encoder**: A pre-trained ResNet50 model is used to extract 2048-dimensional feature vectors from images.
  - **Decoder**: A bidirectional LSTM with an attention mechanism, combined with an embedding layer for text generation.

## Project Steps
### 1. Data Preparation
- **Image Feature Extraction**: Load the pre-trained ResNet50 model, removing the classification head, to extract 2048-dimensional feature vectors for each image. These features are stored in a pickle file for later use.
- **Caption Data Processing**: Captions are cleaned by converting to lowercase, removing non-alphabetic characters, adding start and end tokens, and removing extra spaces.
- **Tokenization**: A tokenizer is used to convert words to unique integer indices. The tokenized sequences are padded to a uniform length.
- **Dataset Splitting**: The data is split into training (90%) and test (10%) sets.

### 2. Model Design and Training
- **Encoder**: Processes image features with dropout and dense layers. The feature vector is projected to match the caption sequence length.
- **Decoder**: Takes tokenized caption sequences, applies embedding, and passes through a bidirectional LSTM. Attention is applied to align the image features with the caption context.
- **Attention Mechanism**: Dot-product attention with selective masking and context vector aggregation is used to align image and caption data.
- **Training**: The model is trained over multiple epochs, using data generators to provide batches of training and validation data.

### 3. Model Evaluation
- **Evaluation Metric**: The model is evaluated using the BLEU score, which measures the similarity between the generated and reference captions.
- **Test Set Prediction**: The trained model is used to generate captions for images in the test set, and the BLEU score is calculated to assess the quality of the generated captions.

## Inference
- **Generate Captions for New Images**: The trained model can generate captions for new images by extracting image features and using the model to predict captions.
- **Sample Caption Generation**: Given an image, the model predicts the caption by iterating over the sequence, selecting words with the highest probabilities, and adding them to the output caption.

## Results
- **BLEU Scores**: The model achieves BLEU-1 and BLEU-2 scores that reflect the accuracy of generated captions relative to reference captions.
- **Example Predictions**: The project provides example images along with predicted captions to demonstrate the performance of the model.

## Next Steps
- **Improving Performance**: Experiment with different model architectures and training strategies to improve caption quality.
- **Additional Evaluation**: Incorporate more advanced evaluation metrics to better gauge the model's performance.
- **Deploying the Model**: Consider deploying the trained model for real-time image captioning applications.
